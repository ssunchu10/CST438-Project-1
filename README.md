# Weather App

This is a Weather Forecasting App built with React Native that provides real-time weather updates for any location in the world. It fetches data from the OpenWeather API and displays it in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, based on user preference. Stores the users' favourite locations as well.

## Key Features

1. Current Weather: Displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and "feels like" temperature for a selected city.

2. Hourly Forecast: Provides weather updates for the current day in 3-hour intervals, including future predictions for morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

3. Search Functionality: Users can search for any city in the world (handled by another teammate) and set it as the default city on the homepage.

4.Location Detection: Upon login, the app detects the user's current location, confirms the city or ZIP code, and displays the weather for that location.
